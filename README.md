        <p>
            In survival mode, I <em>always</em> chop some wood, and when the dark comes, I dig a hole under my chest <br>
            And I maybe put some glass blocks as the roof, and also I use wood pickaxe ---> stone pickaxe and mine stones in a room, I put a door on the exit of the room <br>
            That's all (I'm playing in Minecraft Demo mode)
